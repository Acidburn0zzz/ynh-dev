```

### Run a container

```shell
cd /path/to/dev/env
./ynh-dev run ynh.local testing

You'll be automatically logged in the VM through ssh.

##Â Inside the Virtual machine (VM)

Once logged into your VM, go to `/vagrant` to enjoy folder sharing, and take
advantages of the `ynh-dev` script.

###  Upgrade the container

It will update every debian packages, including YunoHost ones.

    /vagrant/ynh-dev upgrade
